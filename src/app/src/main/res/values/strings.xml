    <string name="tutorial_a_blurb">Welcome to COVIDTracker, an app that tracks COVID-19 and attempts to calculate the percentage chance that you have contracted COVID-19 by analyzing the interactions youâ€™ve had with the people around you using Bluetooth data. All potential risk factors and information presented in this app are the result of thorough research from trusted sources such as the CDC and the Mayo Clinic. Using your personal information and medical history, the app will notify you of the risks involved in contracting COVID-19 so that you can stay safe and healthy, and reminds you to continue to practice proper social distancing protocols.\n\nCOVIDTracker was designed to be easy-to-use, simple, and elegant: that means no hassles, gotchas, or strings attached. The app collects Bluetooth data silently in the background, ensuring that you and the people in your community around you stay safe amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_a_title">Welcome to COVIDTracker!</string>
    <string name="tutorial_c_blurb">Before going out, make sure to check the app\'s map to see which areas of your community are most affected by the spread of COVID-19. Then, you can make an informed decision about which areas of your community are safe to travel to. Additionally, by swiping down on the map screen, you can view your risk of infection and see reminders to practice social distancing.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_c_title">Stay aware</string>
    <string name="tutorial_b_blurb_infected">If you test positive for COVID-19, we recommend you notify us of your test result immediately through the app\'s test reporting system. When you inform us that you\'ve tested positive, our mathematical model will backtrack over all the interactions you\'ve had within two weeks of the test date in order to inform those around you of their risk of infection. Our model is reliant on your self-reported data: the sooner you report a positive test, the better.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_b_blurb_howitworks">Using Bluetooth data collected from your phone, COVIDTracker builds a network of interactions that you\'ve had with the people around you. As people in your community use the app, this network of interactions grows larger and larger, allowing us to generate a probability model that determines the likelihood that an infected person passed the disease along to you.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_d_blurb">As this version of the app represents a prototype of how the app will really appear when fully functioning, there is currently no built-in online connectivity. For the moment, you have been assigned to a random user from a temporary database of users. This user\'s percentage has been calculated via the mathematical model described earlier by analyzing their interaction data with other random users.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_d_title">Information for Prototype</string>
    <string name="info_prototype">You are currently using a mockup version of the app. This version represents what using the app might be like when fully released. Because this version lacks online-connectivity, it is using mockup data generated for the purposes of demonstrating the app. The current mockup database contains <![CDATA[<b>%1$d</b>]]> randomly generated users (<![CDATA[<b>%2$d</b>]]> of which are infected) and <![CDATA[<b>%3$d</b>]]> user-to-user interactions among these randomly-generated users.
